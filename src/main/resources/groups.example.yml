# You can define a custom AngelChest duration for certain groups.
# Players will need the angelchest.group.[groupname] permission.
# If a player is in no group, or the value has not been set for
# any of the player's groups, the default value will be used.
# If a player is in multiple groups, the "best" value is used,
# e.g. the highest duration, highest amount of chests and
# lowest prices.
#
# Available options:
#   angelchest-duration: <duration in seconds>
#   max-allowed-angelchests: <number of chests>
#   price-spawn: <price for spawning the chest>
#   price-open: <price for opening the chest>
#   price-teleport: <price for teleporting to the chest>
#   price-fetch: <price for fetching the chest>
#   xp-percentage: <percentage of how much XP to keep> (e.g. 1 = 100%, 0.5 = 50%, -1 = vanilla behaviour)
#
# Note: You MUST rename this file to groups.yml if you wish to use it.
