# You can blacklist certain items from being put into the AngelChest.
# All blacklisted items will not be put into the AngelChest.
#
# You can define items by material, lore and/or name.
# You can use * as wildcard at the beginning and/or end of
# the material name, but you MUST use "double quotes" when
# doing so. (E.g. "*_HELMET")
# You MUST use the "string list" format for the lore.
# Each line of lore is checked separately. All specified
# lines must match the item, but it's no problem if the
# item has additional lines.
# An item is only blacklisted if ALL specified options match.
# See below for examples.
#
# Available options:
#
#   material: <material> (e.g. DIAMOND_AXE, DIRT, "*_HELMET", or ANY)
#
#   loreContains:        (the item must include every defined line)
#     - "part of any line"
#     - "part of another line"
#
#   loreExact:           (the item must include every defined line)
#     - "exact text of any line"
#     - "exact text of another line"
#
#   nameContains: <part of custom item name>
#
#   nameExact: <exact custom item name> (e.g. "&cMy awesome sword")
#
#   ignoreColors: <true|false> (whether name and lore also check for color codes)
#
#   enchantments:        (the item must include all given enchantments, regardless of their level)
#     - soulbind
#
# Use '&' for color codes. If you set ignoreColors to false, do NOT add the color code.
# If you want to see the exact name and lore values for an item that you hold in your hand,
# enter "/acd blacklist info" to get information about the current item.
# If you wish to copy that text, you can also use it from console like this: "/acd blacklist info <player>"
# You can also use "/acd blacklist add" to add the current item with its exact name and lore to the blacklist.
# Note: You MUST rename this file to blacklist.yml if you wish to use it.
