# You can blacklist certain items from being put into the AngelChest.
# All blacklisted items will not be put into the AngelChest.
#
# You can define items by material, lore and/or name.
# You can use * as wildcard at the beginning and/or end of
# the material name, but you MUST use "double quotes" when
# doing so. (E.g. "*_HELMET")
# You MUST use the "string list" format for the lore.
# Each line of lore is checked separately. All specified
# lines must match the item, but it's no problem if the
# item has additional lines.
# An item is only blacklisted if ALL specified options match.
# See below for examples.
#
# Available options:
#
#   material: <material>                    (E.g. DIAMOND_AXE, DIRT, "*_HELMET", or ANY)
#
#   loreContains:                           (The item lore must contain every defined line)
#     - "part of any line"
#     - "part of another line"
#
#   loreExact:                              (The item lore must exactly match every defined line)
#     - "exact text of any line"
#     - "exact text of another line"
#
#   nameContains: "part of the item name"   (The item name must contain the given name)
#
#   nameExact: "exact item name"            (The item name must exactly match this, e.g. "&cMy awesome sword")
#
#   ignoreColors: <true|false>              (Whether name and lore also check for color codes)
#
#   enchantments:                           (The item must include all given enchantments, regardless of their level)
#     - soulbind
#
#   slot: <slot-number>                     (The item must be in the given slot. Open slot-numbers.png with an image viewer
#                                            or slot-numbers.txt with a text editor to see the available slot numbers)
#
#   force-delete: <true|false>              (When true, AngelChest force-removes the item from both inventory and drops list.
#                                            The default option is "false", meaning AngelChest won't prevent the items from
#                                            being dropped normally, so other plugins can still handle them. When more than
#                                            one blacklist entry matches, the item will be force-deleted if ANY of the entries
#                                            has it set to true.)
#
# Use '&' for color codes. If you set ignoreColors to false, do NOT add the color code.
# If you want to see the exact name and lore values for an item that you hold in your hand,
# enter "/acd blacklist info" to get information about the current item.
# If you wish to copy that text, you can also use it from console like this: "/acd blacklist info <player>"
# You can also use "/acd blacklist add" to add the current item with its exact name and lore to the blacklist.
# Note: You MUST rename this file to blacklist.yml if you wish to use it.

# This makes all helmets drop like in vanilla - if you only want to blacklist worn armor, check out the "slot" option
exampleAllHelmets:
  material: "*_HELMET"

# This makes AngelChest ignore all items with "Kept on Death" in their lore, so other plugins can handle them
exampleSoulbound:

  ignoreColors: true

# This makes AngelChest ignore Slimefun's "Ancient Altar" item, so Slimefun can handle it

    - "&5Multi-Block Altar for"
    - "&5magical Crafting Processes"

# This deletes all diamonds - they won't be in the chest, and they won't drop
exampleDiamonds:
  material: DIAMOND
  force-delete: true
