#### Disabled items  ####
#########################

# Some plugins have items that you automatically get back after death. To
# avoid those from being duplicated, you can just enter their material
# type here. Future versions will also allow to filter for items by
# lore or custom name and more 3rd party plugins hooks

# When using AngelChestPlus, you can instead use the blacklist.yml file
# to filter items according to material, name and lore!

# Example:

# disabled-materials:
# - WOODEN_HOE
# - COMPASS

#########################
#### Disabled worlds ####
#########################

# You can disable AngelChest for certain worlds. Each world's name has to
# be on a separate line, starting with a hyphen and followed by a space

#
# disabled-worlds:
# - world_nether
# - world_the_end

#### WorldGuard Flags ####
##########################

# PREMIUM FEATURE: ONLY AVAILABLE IN AngelChestPlus!

##########################
####    WorldGuard    ####

#
# disabled-worldguard-regions:
# - spawn
# - pvparena

disabled-worldguard-regions:

# If, for some reason, you get errors using WorldGuard and AngelChest together, you can
# disable the WorldGuard integration, but this will also mean you cannot disable
# AngelChest in certain regions. If you get errors, please open an issue at github
# or join our discord: https://discord.jeff-media.de

#########################
## Protection plugins  ##
#########################

# AngelChest can check if a player has permissions to place blocks where he died. If
# the player is prohibited from placing blocks there, AngelChest will not spawn a
# chest if the following option is set to true.
only-spawn-chests-if-player-may-build: false

#########################
##    Other plugins    ##
#########################

# AngelChest can hook into certain 3rd party plugins to improve the chest
# generation. None of those plugins is required, and you do NOT have to
# disable the integration if a certain plugin is not installed.

# When you have Slimefun installed, AngelChest can check for "Soulbound" items
# and prevent those from being put into the chest.
use-slimefun: true

# When you have ExecutableItems installed, AngelChest can check for "Keep on Death"
# items and prevent those from being put into the chest.
use-executableitems: true

# There are many other plugins adding "Soulbound" items. AngelChest can try
# to detect those as well and prevent those from being put into the chest.
check-generic-soulbound: true

# EliteMobs' soulbound feature is a bit different. Those items will NOT be
# kept on death, but they would be detected by the generic soulbound detection.
# If you set the following option to false, EliteMobs' soulbound items will
# behave like "normal" soulbound items, meaning they will be kept in your
# inventory on death. If the option is set to true, the items will behave
# like normally when using EliteMobs: the items will go into the chest like
# regular items.
exempt-elitemobs-soulbound-items-from-generic-soulbound-detection: true

# Some plugins make you keep your items on death, e.g. Essentials when you are /op.
# AngelChest respects that, but you can also set the following option to true to always
# get a chest, regardless of the keepInventory flag.
# Note that many plugins (including EssentialsX) also clear your drops list for
# totally retarded reasons, although it's not needed and prevents AngelChest
# from detecting the drops. If you get the message that your inventory was empty
# on death, try setting the "event-priority" below to LOWEST, then raise it slowly
# to the highest possible value where it still works.
ignore-keep-inventory: false

# You can define the priority on which AngelChest detects the player's drops. When you use plugins to
# manipulate what items a player drops on death, consider setting this to a high value (e.g. HIGHEST
# or MONITOR.
# If you experience problems with some items not being put into the chest but being dropped next to it,
# try to lower the priority of AngelChest until the drops get detected.
# If you have problems with the chest not spawning at all (but remaining in the player's inventory),
# consider using a low priority (e.g. LOWEST)
# Available priorities (from high to low): MONITOR, HIGHEST, HIGH, NORMAL, LOW, LOWEST
# I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU LEAVE THIS ON HIGHEST! ONLY CHANGE THIS IF KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!
# WHEN IN DOUBT, CONTACT ME ON DISCORD: https://discord.jeff-media.de
