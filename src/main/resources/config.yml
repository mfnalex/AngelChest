#### Disabled items  ####
#########################

# Some plugins have items that you automatically get back after death. To
# avoid those from being duplicated, you can just enter their material

# disabled-materials:
# - WOODEN_HOE
# - COMPASS

#### Disabled worlds ####
#########################

# You can disable AngelChest for certain worlds. Each world's name has to
# be on a separate line, starting with a hyphen and followed by a space

# Example:
#
# disabled-worlds:
# - world_nether

#
# disabled-worldguard-regions:
# - spawn
# - pvparena

disabled-worldguard-regions:

# If, for some reason, you get errors using WorldGuard and AngelChest together, you can

## Protection plugins  ##
#########################

# AngelChest can check if a player has permissions to place blocks where he died. If

#########################
##    Other plugins    ##
#########################

# AngelChest can hook into certain 3rd party plugins to improve the chest
# generation. None of those plugins is required, and you do NOT have to
# disable the integration if a certain plugin is not installed.

# When you have Slimefun installed, AngelChest can check for "Soulbound" items
# and prevent those from being put into the chest.
use-slimefun: true

# There are many other plugins adding "Soulbound" items. AngelChest can try
# to detect those as well and prevent those from being put into the chest.
check-generic-soulbound: true

# You can define the priority on which AngelChest detects the player's drops. When you use plugins to
# manipulate what items a player drops on death, consider setting this to a high value (e.g. HIGHEST
# or MONITOR.
# If you experience problems with some items not being put into the chest but being dropped next to it,
# try to lower the priority of AngelChest until the drops get detected.
# If you have problems with the chest not spawning at all (but remaining in the player's inventory),
# consider using a low priority (e.g. LOWEST)
# Available priorities (from high to low): MONITOR, HIGHEST, HIGH, NORMAL (default), LOW, LOWEST
event-priority: HIGHEST
