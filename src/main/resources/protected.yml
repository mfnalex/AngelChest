# You can define who is able to open protected chests.
#
# PREMIUM FEATURE: ONLY AVAILABLE IN AngelChest Plus!
# In the free version, only the owner can open protected chests, and people with the permission "angelchest.protect.ignore".
#
# If you want everyone to be able to open the chests, just don't give your players the "angelchest.protect" permission.
#
# For more information about the groups, see groups.yml file. In short: give players the permission "angelchest.group.<groupname>"
# to give them access to that group.
#
# Note that the "angelchest.protect.ignore" will always let you open EVERY chest.
